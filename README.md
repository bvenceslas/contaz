## Getting Started

The project is public

## Built With

- React js
- Json Server

## How it works

once you've cloned the project, open it in visual studio

First, install dependencies using this command in the terminal

`yarn` or `yarn install` 

Second, in order to use data, make sure to run this command

`npx json-server --watch src/data/db.json --port 7000`

As we're using json server, the file located to *src/data/db.json* will run and create some endpoints as if it was coming from a backend app.

Third, you can now run the project locally by typing `yarn start`

or you can run this [live version]()

Next, have a good hacking
